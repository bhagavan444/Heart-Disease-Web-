# Heart Disease Prediction Web Application

## Overview
The Heart Disease Prediction Web Application is a machine learning–based system designed to predict the likelihood of heart disease in a patient based on clinical parameters. The application provides fast, accurate predictions through a simple and user-friendly web interface, enabling early risk assessment and decision support.

## Problem Statement
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Early detection plays a crucial role in prevention and treatment. Traditional diagnosis methods can be time-consuming and require expert interpretation. This project aims to assist healthcare decision-making by using machine learning models to predict heart disease risk efficiently.

## Key Features
- Heart disease risk prediction using machine learning
- Input of patient health parameters through a web form
- Real-time prediction results
- REST API-based backend
- Clean and responsive user interface
- Fast and accurate inference

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- React.js
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

### Backend
- Python
- Flask
- REST APIs

### Machine Learning
- Scikit-learn
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Pandas
- NumPy

### Tools & Platforms
- Git & GitHub
- VS Code
- Postman

## System Architecture
1. User enters medical details such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol, and heart rate.
2. Frontend sends the input data to the Flask backend API.
3. Backend preprocesses the input data.
4. Machine learning model predicts the presence or absence of heart disease.
5. Prediction result is returned and displayed on the web interface.

## Machine Learning Workflow
- Dataset collection and analysis
- Data preprocessing and feature selection
- Model training and evaluation
- Model deployment using Flask
- Real-time inference via REST API
